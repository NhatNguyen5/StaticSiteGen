Let's build a static site generator from scratch!

What Is a Static Site Generator?

A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files).

Static sites are very popular in the real world for blogs and other content-heavy websites because they're lightning-fast, secure, and easy to host. For example, the Boot.dev Blog is a production-level static site generated with Hugo.
Static vs. Dynamic Sites

A static site is what it sounds like... static. The content is always the same. Users can not:

    Upload files
    Log in
    Leave comments
    Save preferences

You would need a dynamic site for that stuff, which is usually powered by a database and a custom web server. Static sites are great for:

    Blogs
    Portfolios
    Landing pages
    Documentation
